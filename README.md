## Steps to download and load the data into database
1. Extract the downloaded folder onto your local system.
2. Optionally, create a PostgreSQL database (Note: I used PostgreSQL for analysis).
3. Create a virtual environment and activate the environment and install the packages from the requirements file.
4. Open the Python file and update the PostgreSQL database credentials with your own.
5. Note: If you are using a different database other than PostgreSQL, you may need to modify a few lines of Python code.
6. Once everything is set, run the Python file. It will create and load the data into the specified tables in PostgreSQL.
7. Navigate to PostgreSQL and verify if the data has been loaded successfully.
8. Voila! You can now commence with the analysis of this famous painting dataset.
9. As a bonus, I am providing a set of questions to guide you forward (Special thanks to TechTFQ - Thoufiq Mohammed - for the detailed video and the insightful questions for analysis).
